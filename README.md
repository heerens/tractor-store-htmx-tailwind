# The Tractor Store - HTMX and Tailwind 

A micro frontends sample implementation of [The Tractor Store](https://micro-frontends.org/tractor-store/) built with Spring Boot + JTE, ESI, HTMX and Tailwind. 
It's a reference implementation to Alexander Heerens' article  [Radically Simple Web Architecture](https://medium.com/@alexander.heerens/radically-simple-web-architecture-a-web-application-blueprint-for-startups-and-small-enterprises-f503a5f36381) and based on the [Blueprint](https://github.com/neuland/tractor-store-blueprint).

**Live Demo:** [https://tractorstore.inauditech.com/](https://tractorstore.inauditech.com/)

## About This Implementation

### Architecture 

The architecture of the application is based on the [Radically Simple Web Architecture](https://medium.com/@alexander.heerens/radically-simple-web-architecture-a-web-application-blueprint-for-startups-and-small-enterprises-f503a5f36381) article.

There are two teams that both run a Modular Monolith (Spring Boot app) containing multiple Self Contained Systems (Module). Each SCS represents an independent business domain (DDD).

Routing, Page Assembly (Server-Side Integration) and Pattern Library hosting is part of a NGINX.

### Limitations & Remarks 

This implementation is deliberately kept simple to focus on the micro frontends aspects. URLs are hardcoded, components could be more DRY and no linting, testing or type-safety is implemented. In a real-world scenario, these aspects should be addressed properly.

#### Tailwind v2

For the use of Tailwind v3+ each domain must create its own css files during the build and SCSs must include each other's resources.

#### Data Replication

Product data is provided by the `product` domain and pull via data feed (https://tractorstore.inauditech.com/product/api/v1/feed) by other domain such as `checkout`.

The demo `checkout` pulls all data on startup and holds data in memory. A robust production application would run a periodic job, pull only updates and persist data.

#### One Docker Image

For demo purposes the `Dockerfile` will create an image containing and running the two Spring apps and the NGINX. In a real-word scenario these three would have their own pipelines, docker images and deployments. 

#### JTE

Because the Modular Monolith is one Spring Boot app, all modules share one class namespace. That means all classes, packages and JTE templates need to have a namespace to avoid conflicts.

By default, JTE does not support multiple template directories (modules), and hab to create an own `JteModuleConfiguration` to make the possible.

## How to run locally

# build the app + nginx image
docker-compose build 
```

Start the development server:

```bash
docker-compose up 
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the integrated application.
